The goal of this uni project is to analyze the performance of five diferent classification models on the Mammographic Mass dataset 
(https://bigml.com/user/TotyB/gallery/dataset/509a98c6035d0706dd0001dd). The classification models
are
* K-Nearest Neighbour
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forrest

The feature that is being predicted is the type of tumor (benign or malig-
nant). The models are trained on the rest of the features from the dataset,
which are
* BI-RADS
* Age of patient
* Shape of the abnormal mass detected
* Mass margin
* Tumor mass density

The results show a superiority of the Random Forrest Classifier, with an
accuracy of 84,53% and more significantly, a recall of 83,41%.

An in-depth experimental analysis is provided in the pdf file.
